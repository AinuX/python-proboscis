Proboscis
=========

An extension for Nose that facilitates higher level testing.

Changes how test classes are discovered by forcing them to register via
decorators which contain useful metadata such as what groups they are in,
whether or not they have dependencies on other tests, and if they should be
ignored.

Proboscis sorts all registered tests into the desired run order then
constructs a test suite which it passes to Nose.  It can also filter this list
so that it's possible to specify which groups of tests you wish to run without
passing in the exact test classes.  At runtime, tests which depend on other
tests that have failed are automatically marked as skipped.

Much of this functionality was "inspired" by TestNG.  If you're coming from
that framework, the main features Proboscis currently offers are dependent test
ordering (currently limited to the class level) and the ability to arrange your
tests into groups independent of the structure of their modules or packages.
